# Readable Project

This is the final assessment project for [Udacity's React course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) - React & Redux section.

## Project Overview

This is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments (along the lines of Hacker News and Reddit).

**NOTE**: Work In Progress!
